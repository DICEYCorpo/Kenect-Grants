The CLM program will be implemented in the three PEPFAR provinces including Kinshasa, Haut-Katanga and Lualaba. Community-led monitoring or CLM is a routinized process initiated and implemented by local HIV-positive and HIV-affected communities, community-based organizations and other civil society groups that identifies HIV service delivery successes, diagnoses problems, uses quantitative and qualitative data to overcome barriers and ensure that HIV service beneficiaries receive optimal client-centered services.  The intention of CLM is for local community leadership to get inputs from recipients and providers of HIV services, including key populations and underserved groups, in a routine and systematic manner and translate their findings into action and change in collaboration with host governments and health systems.  CLM is a tool within the community engagement process, a strategic collaboration of multiple partnerships within a designated geographic location. CLM leverages community engagement to empower community members to identify successes, diagnose problems, use data-driven approaches to overcome barriers, and ensure beneficiaries receive optimal client-centered services in a productive, collaborative, respectful, and solutions-oriented manner. This community-driven approach to addressing health challenges often evolves into advocacy, whether driven by the individual, community, organizations, or institutions. The CLM program is funded through the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). The goal of PEPFAR in DRC is to support efforts to achieve HIV epidemic control through implementation of evidence-based interventions to drive progress in HIV prevention, care and treatment and ultimately, save lives.  Through the PEPFAR Coordination Office, the U.S. Embassy in Kinshasa administers this Community grants program and is seeking proposals from registered local Community-based organizations and other civil society groups, networks of key populations (KP), people living with HIV (PLHIV), youth and adolescents including children and other HIV-affected groups, or community entities that gather quantitative and qualitative data about HIV services and whose mission and activities focuses on HIV programming.  CLM plays key role to ensuring availability, accessibility, affordability, acceptability, and delivery of timely and quality HIV care and services. CLM will raise public awareness on the rights of PLHIV, KP groups, youth and adolescents and other affected communities, will empower beneficiaries and affected communities to speak out, to increase health literacy, to expand engagement with health service providers, to support demand creation, on one hand; and on the other hand, CLM will hold decisions makers accountable for executing changes to improve HIV service delivery.  CLM data will be collected using standardized tools and synthesized through a variety of methods that reveal insights from communities about problems and solutions to health and HIV service delivery at: the facility, community, sub-national and national levels. Thus, CLM data builds evidence on what works well, what is not working and what needs to be improved, with suggestions for targeted action to improve outcomes. Monitoring data should reflect an ‘added value’ and not duplicate collection of routine data already available to PEPFAR, through its standard reporting. ‘Added value’ monitoring data includes, but not limited to information from beneficiaries about their experience with the health facility, information about barriers and enablers to access and retention in services etc. CLM mechanisms must be routine to ensure follow up and continuous improvement for sustainability.  Results from CLM will be shared with all the stakeholders including host governments, health systems, PEPFAR implementing partners and the PEPFAR team on a regular and systematic basis (monthly, quarterly, and annually), for informing decisions, to improve time and quality service delivery.",Nationwide,Health,100000,"Feb 09, 2024 12:00:00 AM EST"

FY2024 Sea Grant Programs Only - Regional Aquaculture Communications/Literacy Collaboratives,https://grants.gov/search-results-detail/351498,"The National Sea Grant College Program was enacted by the U.S. Congress in 1966 (amended in 2020, Public Law 116-221) to support leveraged federal and state partnerships that harness the intellectual capacity of the nation’s universities and research institutions to solve problems and generate opportunities in coastal communities.
Subject to the availability of funding, Sea Grant anticipates approximately $3,000,000 will be available for research projects and programs to create four Regional Aquaculture Communications/Literacy Collaboratives with up to $750,000 available for each. 
The overall goal of this competition is to support development and expansion of aquaculture communications and literacy approaches applicable to specific regions and aquaculture operations. The four regions in which Collaboratives are sought to be established (including states and territories) are:

West Coast/Alaska/Pacific (CA, OR, WA, AK, HI, GU, and other Pacific territories)
Southeast/GOM (TX, LA, MS. AL, FL, PR, US Virgin Islands, GA, SC, NC)
Northeast/mid-Atlantic (VA, MD, DE, NJ, NY, CT, RI, MA, NH, ME)
Great Lakes (NY, VT, PA, OH, IN, IL, MI, WI, MN) 

While a regional approach is the required mechanism for achieving these goals, it is expected that the individual Collaboratives will interact with one another to support shared National level interests. Proposals are sought that will support collaborative, multi-SG Program efforts within each region to address aquaculture communications and literacy needs, and ensure that efforts benefit the aquaculture community as well as seafood consumers and the general public. These investments are consistent with Sea Grant’s focus area of Sustainable Fisheries and Aquaculture (SFA) and the Sea Grant Network’s 10-year Aquaculture Vision, both which support NOAA and Department of Commerce aquaculture goals. 
This competition is open to all Sea Grant Programs. A Sea Grant Program may submit or be a part of more than one application. Programs are encouraged to partner with other Sea Grant Programs and/or other entities such as individuals, State and Tribal Agencies/Organizations, HBCUs/MSIs, NGOs, aquaculture industry members and associations, universities, and colleges, including community colleges. Federal agencies and their personnel are not permitted to receive federal funding under this competition; however, federal scientists and other employees can serve as uncompensated partners or co-Principal Investigators on applications. Federal labs and offices can also make available specialized expertise, facilities or equipment to applicants but cannot be compensated under this competition for their use, nor can the value of such assets be used as match.

 Notice of Funding Opportunity


Funding Opportunity Title:  2024-25 EdUSA Opportunity Funds Program for Graduate Study  
Funding Opportunity Number: FY2024VE005
Deadline for Applications: March 1, 2024 
Assistance Listing Number: 19.040  
Total Amount Available: up to $75,000 USD

A. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The Public Diplomacy Section at the Venezuela Affairs Unit (VAU) is seeking proposals to develop and carry out a project focused on promoting U.S. higher education opportunities for high-achieving, financially disadvantaged Venezuelan students at the post-graduate level in the Agricultural STEM and Public Health fields.

Please carefully follow all instructions below. 

Priority Region: Project activities must take place in Venezuela and the United States and be directed at Venezuelan audiences/participants.

Program Objectives:  The grantee will work in coordination with VAU Public Diplomacy in support of the 2024-25 EducationUSA Opportunity Funds Program for Graduate Study in the United States.  This program will assist highly qualified prospective Venezuelan graduate students who are likely to be awarded full financial aid from U.S. colleges and universities but lack the financial resources to cover the up-front costs of required standardized admission tests, application fees, international and domestic airfare, visa fees, SEVIS fees, and settling-in allowance.  The grantee will partner with the Venezuela EducationUSA Network to select and advise up to 25 Opportunity Funds students. 

Individuals and institutions interested in bidding on this cooperative agreement are asked to submit a proposal to administer the Opportunity Funds up to $75,000 and manage two phases of the EducationUSA advising process for 2024-25.  The first phase requires coordination and payment for qualified prospective students to take standardized tests.  Throughout this phase, the grantee is expected to assist EdUSA advisers with logistical support in providing advising sessions for the Opportunity Fund Program (OFP) students.  If space allows, non-OFP, EducationUSA scholars can attend these virtual sessions.  These sessions are expected to include comprehensive coaching on the U.S. application process, financial awards/aid, essay and recommendation letter writing, extra-curricular and volunteer activities, transcripts and equivalencies, and similar subjects related to undergraduate or graduate admissions at U.S. colleges and universities.

The second phase requires the recipient to manage the travel logistics of approximately 15-20 students, including visa and SEVIS fees, international airfare, domestic airfare, settling-in allowance, and other related expenses.  The grantee will communicate with the students and advisers, coordinate visa appointments at the appropriate U.S. consulate, make travel arrangements for domestic and international travel, and coordinate payment to the students of settling-in and other related allowances.  The successful grantee will demonstrate an ability to effectively handle funds, coordinate logistics, and finalize payments in a timely manner. 

Both phases can be managed virtually, with regular web and phone-based counselling sessions for selected Venezuelan candidates.  

Participants and Audiences:

Prospective Venezuelan graduate students in the STEM Agriculture and Public Health fields interested in studying in the United States.

FY2024 Sea Grant Programs Only - FY2024 Aquaculture Technologies and Education Travel Grants,https://grants.gov/search-results-detail/351515,"The National Sea Grant College Program was enacted by the U.S. Congress in 1966 (amended in 2020, Public Law 116-221) to support leveraged federal and state partnerships that harness the intellectual capacity of the nation’s universities and research institutions to solve problems and generate opportunities in coastal communities.
Subject to the availability of funding, the National Sea Grant Office (NSGO) anticipates that up to $500,000 in FY 2024 federal funds will be available to Sea Grant programs to support approximately 10-20 projects for a duration of up to one year. Awards will be made for no more than $50,000 in federal funds per project. Proposals are sought that provide an opportunity for researchers (faculty, graduate students, post-doctoral), Sea Grant extension personnel, and industry members, or a mixture of participants, to enhance knowledge of aquaculture technologies, production practices and systems, and associated topics pertinent to the species or species group of interest to participants. The goal of this opportunity is that participants will utilize the knowledge and expertise gained through their travel experiences in their approach to improve aquaculture research, extension, or aquaculture production and/or business activities that will benefit the U.S. aquaculture industry. Available funding can be used to support travel costs, salary, and costs associated with outreach activities following travel. Travel must be focused on visiting aquaculture sites or facilities, either public or private. Funding for research activities is not permitted through this announcement. Successful applications will: identify, justify, and describe the need or needs to be addressed regarding improvement of aquaculture research, extension, or production activities, describe and document the proposed plan regarding how the proposed travel activities will address the identified need or needs, describe how the proposed activities will enhance aquaculture-related activities of project participants, and describe how the proposed activities will benefit the U.S. aquaculture industry and associated stakeholders. Applications require the standard 50% non-federal match for Sea Grant projects. Please note that it is envisioned that this funding opportunity, with potential variation in total funding available, will be reinstated annually, contingent on available funding. These investments are consistent with Sea Grant’s focus area of Sustainable Fisheries and Aquaculture (SFA) and the Sea Grant Network’s 10-year Aquaculture Vision, and support NOAA and Department of Commerce aquaculture goals. 
This competition is open to all Sea Grant Programs. A Sea Grant Program may submit more than one application. Programs are encouraged to partner with other Sea Grant Programs and/or other entities such as individuals, State and Tribal Agencies/Organizations, HBCUs/MSIs, NGOs, aquaculture industry members and associations, universities, and colleges (including community colleges). Federal agencies and their personnel are not permitted to receive federal funding under this competition; however, federal scientists and other employees can serve as uncompensated partners or co-Principal Investigators on applications. Federal labs and offices can also make available specialized expertise, facilities or equipment to applicants but cannot be compensated under this competition for their use, nor can the value of such assets be used as match. International travel is permitted, however international travel must conform to guidelines specified by the Fly America Act.

The correction notice makes important changes to the Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) for the Community Connect Program for Fiscal Year 2023, published on March 20, 2023, and extends the Community Connect Program application window until February 20, 2024. The correction notice revises the definition of an eligible Proposed Funded Service Area (PFSA) under the Community Connect Program to ensure the program is administered in compliance with the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (2018 Farm Bill). Under the revised definition, a PFSA must lack access to broadband service of 10 Megabits per second (Mbps) downstream plus 1 Mbps upstream to be eligible for consideration for Community Connect Program funding. Additionally, any areas that have received other federal funding to construct terrestrial broadband facilities providing at least 10/1 Mbps service in the project’s PFSA will be deemed ineligible. Any applicant that applied for the Community Connect Program under the March 20, 2023, NOFO must resubmit their application in order to be considered for funding. RUS recognizes that this requirement may result in delays and additional work for FY 2023 applicants. In an effort to minimize the amount of time required to resubmit an application from the FY 2023 funding window, applicants with previously submitted applications will have access to the submitted application data and will have the opportunity to make any edits before resubmitting the application. It is strongly encouraged that applicants review the new eligibility information to ensure that the previously submitted application is still eligible. The extended application window will also be open to new applicants that meet Community Connect Program eligibility requirements.

The Community Connect Grant Program provides financial assistance to eligible applicants that will provide service at or above the Broadband Grant Speed to all premises in rural, economically-challenged communities where broadband service does not exist. The deployment of broadband services on a “community-oriented connectivity” basis stimulates economic development and provides enhanced educational and health care opportunities in rural areas. RUS will give priority to rural areas that demonstrate the greatest need for broadband services, based on the criteria contained herein.

The regulation for the Community Connect Grant Program can be found at 7 CFR part 1739.

All applicants should carefully review and prepare their applications according to instructions in the FY 2023 Community Connect Grant Program Application Guide (Application Guide) and program resources.

These information gaps can result in multiple protocol changes before and after trial start-up, leading to the need for additional time and expenses that may prevent study completion. Further, the suitability and feasibility of new trial designs, which minimize infrastructure and reduce costs may need to be tested in the context of a particular intervention, at-risk group, symptom or venue.
